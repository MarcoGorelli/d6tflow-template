# d6tflow - Project Templates

Templates with common design patterns for https://github.com/d6t/d6tflow

They allow you to have a clean and scalable project structure for data science projects.

## Structure

`task.py`: workflow tasks  
`cfg.py`: parameter and other config  
`run.py`: execute workflow tasks  
`visualize.py`: use outputs for further analysis  
`visualize.ipynb`: use outputs in jupyter notebook  
`.creds.yaml`: optional file with protected credentials in [yaml format](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html), not commited to git to protect credentials
